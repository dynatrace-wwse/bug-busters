## Dynatrace Bug Buster Bug Finding Expedition

## What's this bug finding tutorial all about
In this bug finding tutorial it's your job (with a few hints) to find bugs in two applications:

- BugZappers - an asteroids style game
- Todo App - a todo app for keeping track of todo tasks

As part of the tasks you will utilize Dynatraces new Live Debugger, Logs, and Traces apps.

The Live Debugger is a solution within the package of [Observability for Developers](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/observe/applications-and-microservices/developer-observability){target=_blank} of the Dynatrace Platform which provides developers with instant access to code-level debug data needed to troubleshoot and understand complex, modern applications with no extra coding, redeployments, or restarts.
